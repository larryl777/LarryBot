# LarryBot

Personal Utility Discord Bot made with JavaScript and Node.js

Implemented a relation database using SQLite and Sequelize where users can personalize their profile. Additionally added a feature where users can add words to a databank, and can either edit or remove said word from the data. 


Currently implementing an event feature that will track profanity used, and users will be flagged each time they send a message that contains cuss words which will be stored in a database with a counter. Counter can then be used to determine warnings or kick/bans. 

**Currently Working On This Project**

This repo will be periodically updated as changes are made
