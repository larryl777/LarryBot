**Currently Working On This Project as of September 2, 2024**


Personal Utility Discord Bot made with JavaScript and Node.js

Implemented a relation database using SQLite and Sequelize where users can personalize their profile. Additionally added a feature where users can add words to an expandable databank, where they can either edit or remove said word from the data. Databases are unique to each server, where I took account into server id's and had the bot store data accordingly. 


Currently implementing an event feature that will track profanity used, where the bot will search through the data base to see if a cuss word in the database was sent in the channel. Users will be flagged each time they send a message that contains cuss words from the DB which will be stored in a database with a counter. Counter can then be used to determine warnings or kick/bans. 



This repo will be periodically updated as changes are made
